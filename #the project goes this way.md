#the project goes this way
#write code to pull in hourly temperature data and store in a csv/cloud bucket
#use this file to train a model to predict temp for each hour  
#make sure you use logging, and log experiments with mlflow 
#once this is done, create an inference pipelinee/script that will read hourly data, and give out predictions
#this should shouw viz in the dashbaord 
#do the above locally first 
##Step 2:
#dockerise this(ask if you need to dockerise the whole app or just inference script)
#use gcp to schedule hourly runs
